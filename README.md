# 🔐 Access Manager

A **full-stack MERN web application** built for role-based access control (RBAC). This system allows users to register, log in, and access protected resources based on their assigned roles: **Admin**, **Manager**, or **Employee**. It simulates real-world authorization flows found in enterprise-level SaaS platforms.
